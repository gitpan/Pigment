NAME
    Pigment - User interfaces with embedded multimedia

SYNOPSIS
    See the "examples/" directory.

DESCRIPTION
    Pigment allows building of user interfaces with embedded multimedia
    components. It is designed with portability in mind and its plugin
    system will select a particular underlying graphical API on each
    platform. This module binds the pigment library to perl.

INITIALISATION
  Pigment->init
    Initializes Pigment. Automatically parses @ARGV, stripping any options
    known Pigment. This is called implicitly by "use Pigment;" unless the
    "-no_init" option is specified.

  boolean = Pigment->init_check
    Checks if initialization is possible. Returns a true value if so.

  Pigment->deinit
    Deinitializs Pigment.

MAINLOOP
  Pigment->main
    Runs the mainloop. Will not return until terminated with "main_quit".

  Pigment->main_quit
    Quits running the mainloop.

  boolean = Pigment->events_pending
    Checks if there are events that weren't processed by the mainloop yet.
    Blocks until at least one event was processed.

  Pigment->main_iteration
    Run one iteration of the mainloop, then return.

  Pigment->main_iteration_do ($blocking)
    *   $blocking (boolean)

    Run one iteration of the mainloop, then return. Same as
    "main_iteration", but allows passing a false value as the only argument
    to prevent blocking if there are no events to be processed.

VERSION CHECKING
  (major, minor, micro, nano) = Pigment->version
    Returns the version information of the Pigment library this module was
    compiled against.

  string = Pigment->version_string
    Returns a textual description of the pigment library version.
